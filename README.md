Tech Chase

https://shongsdu.github.io/TechChaseWeb/

Made in Unity 5.3.1.

App Summary

With this app, you'll be able to practice your tech chase reactions on the top 8 characters from 
the current Melee tier list (Fox, Falco, Sheik, Marth, Jiggs, Peach, Falcon, and ICs).
After selecting a character, they will randomly perform one of the four techs (Left, Right, In-place, and Miss). 
You then have to react and select the correct tech being performed. 
The faster you do this, the more points you'll get. 
If you guess incorrectly or after the animation is over, you'll lose a stock. 
When you lose all 4 stocks the game is over. Try and see how high of a score you can get!
